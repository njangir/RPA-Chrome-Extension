## Technical Details

### Element Finding Strategy
The test flow uses the same element finding logic as the main player:
1. User-selected selector preference (if available)
2. Original recorded selector
3. Generated fallback selectors based on element signature
4. Multiple attribute combinations
5. SAP UI5 specific selectors

### Selector Types Generated
- **Primary**: Original recorded selector
- **ID**: Element ID selectors with fallbacks
- **Data Test ID**: Most reliable for testing
- **Name**: Form element name attributes
- **Aria Label**: Accessibility labels
- **Placeholder**: Input placeholder text
- **Classes**: CSS class-based selectors
- **Combinations**: Multiple attribute combinations
- **Custom**: User-defined selectors

### Highlighting System
- Red outline (3px solid) around target element
- Light red background overlay
- Smooth scrolling to bring element into view
- Automatic cleanup when moving to next step

### Data Persistence
- Selector preferences are saved in Chrome storage
- Test results are logged to console
- Step confirmations are tracked in memory

## Troubleshooting

### Element Not Found
- Check if the page has loaded completely
- Try refreshing the page and testing again
- Use "Change Selector" to try alternative selectors
- Check if the element is in a different frame

### Highlighting Not Working
- Ensure the element is visible on the page
- Check if the page has restrictive CSS
- Try scrolling to the element manually

### Selector Issues
- Use browser dev tools to inspect the element
- Try simpler selectors (ID, class, tag)
- Check for dynamic content that changes selectors

## Best Practices

1. **Test After Recording**: Always test your flow immediately after recording
2. **Use Stable Selectors**: Prefer ID and data-testid attributes
3. **Avoid Dynamic Content**: Be cautious with elements that change frequently
4. **Test on Different Pages**: Verify selectors work across different page states
5. **Save Good Selectors**: Use the selector change feature to save reliable selectors
