# Advanced RPA Features Documentation

## Overview

This extension now supports advanced automation scenarios including:
- **URL Navigation from Dataset**: Navigate to different URLs for each data row
- **Dynamic Element Finding**: Find elements by their text content or position
- **Hierarchical Data Loops**: Create nested structures like pathwaysâ†’sectionsâ†’items

## New Step Types

### 1. Navigate URL (`navigate_url`)

Navigate to a URL from a dataset column or static URL.

**Use Case**: Open different product pages, user profiles, or forms for each data row.

**How to Insert**:
1. Click "âž• Insert Special Step"
2. Select "Navigate URL"
3. Choose a dataset column containing URLs, OR enter a static URL
4. Click "Insert Step"

**Example**: If your dataset has a "ProductURL" column, the flow will navigate to each product page before processing that row.

### 2. Find By Value (`find_by_value`)

Find and interact with an element containing specific text from your dataset.

**Use Case**: 
- Click a button that says "Edit" or "Delete"
- Select a specific item from a list
- Find and click a product name

**How to Insert**:
1. Click "âž• Insert Special Step"
2. Select "Find By Value"
3. Choose the dataset column containing the text to search for
4. Select action: Click, Hover, or Focus
5. Optionally enable "Exact match" or "Case sensitive"
6. Click "Insert Step"

**Search Strategy**: The system tries multiple strategies:
1. Exact text match
2. Contains match (partial)
3. Word-by-word match
4. Attribute matching (aria-label, title, alt, placeholder)

**Example**: If your dataset has "ItemName" column with values like "Item 1", "Item 2", the flow will find and click each item by name.

### 3. Find By Index (`find_by_index`)

Select the Nth element from a collection of similar elements.

**Use Case**:
- Select the 3rd button in a list
- Click a specific row in a table
- Choose an item by position

**How to Insert**:
1. Click "âž• Insert Special Step"
2. Select "Find By Index"
3. Enter CSS selector that matches multiple elements (e.g., `ul li`, `.item`)
4. Enter index (0-based) or use `{ColumnName}` for dataset-driven index
5. Select action: Click or Hover
6. Click "Insert Step"

**Example**: Selector `ul.products li` with index `2` will click the 3rd item in the products list.

### 4. Loop Groups (`loop_group`)

Create repeating sections of steps based on data grouping.

**Use Case**: Hierarchical data processing like:
- Create pathway â†’ Add multiple sections â†’ Add items to each section
- Create order â†’ Add multiple line items
- Create project â†’ Add multiple tasks â†’ Add subtasks to each task

**How to Insert**:
1. Click "âž• Insert Special Step" where loop should start
2. Select "Loop Start"
3. Choose the column to group by (e.g., "Section Title")
4. Optionally add a descriptive name
5. Click "Insert Step"
6. Add regular steps that should repeat for each group
7. Click "âž• Insert Special Step" where loop should end
8. Select "Loop End"
9. Click "Insert Step"

**Nested Loops**: You can nest up to 3 levels deep for complex hierarchies.

## Example Scenario: Creating Pathways with Sections and Items

### Dataset Structure (sample-scene.csv):
```csv
Pathway,Section Title,Section Description,Content
Pathway 1,Section 1,Description 1,Item 1
Pathway 1,Section 1,Description 1,Item 2
Pathway 1,Section 2,Description 2,Item 3
Pathway 1,Section 2,Description 2,Item 4
Pathway 1,Section 2,Description 2,Item 5
```

### Flow Structure:

```
1. [Click] "Create Pathway" button
2. [Input] Pathway name (use dataset column "Pathway")
3. [Click] "Save Pathway" button
4. [Loop Start] Group by: "Section Title"
   5. [Click] "Add Section" button
   6. [Input] Section title (use dataset column "Section Title")
   7. [Input] Section description (use dataset column "Section Description")
   8. [Click] "Save Section" button
   9. [Loop Start] Group by: "Content"
      10. [Click] "Add Item" button
      11. [Find By Value] Search for text from "Content" column, Action: Click
   12. [Loop End]
13. [Loop End]
```

### Execution Result:
- Creates 1 pathway ("Pathway 1")
- Creates 2 sections ("Section 1" and "Section 2")
- Adds 2 items to Section 1 (Item 1, Item 2)
- Adds 3 items to Section 2 (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5)

**Preview Message**: 
```
Will process: 1 Pathway(s) â†’ 2 Section Title(s) â†’ 5 Content(s) (6 total rows)
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Testing Your Flow
- Use the "ðŸ§ª Test Flow" feature to validate each step
- Test with a small dataset first (2-3 rows)
- Check loop structure using the visual nesting indicators

### 2. Dataset Preparation
- Ensure grouping columns have consistent values
- Use headers that clearly indicate the data purpose
- Group data is arranged in hierarchical order

### 3. Loop Group Design
- Keep loops simple (max 3 levels deep)
- Test inner loops independently first
- Use descriptive names for loop groups

### 4. Error Handling
- The extension will stop if an element isn't found
- Use "Find By Value" with partial matching for better flexibility
- Test selectors using the selector dropdown in Test Flow mode

### 5. Performance
- Large datasets with deep nesting may take time
- Use the execution preview to estimate complexity
- Consider breaking very large datasets into batches

## Visual Indicators

In the accordion view, loop groups are shown with:
- **Purple left border**: Loop start/end markers
- **Indentation**: Steps inside loops are indented
- **Loop info badge**: Shows grouping column name

## Backward Compatibility

All existing flows continue to work exactly as before. New features are:
- Completely optional
- Only activated when you insert special steps
- Don't affect regular recorded steps

## Troubleshooting

### "Element not found" errors
- Check if selector is stable across page reloads
- Use "Find By Value" instead of recorded selector
- Try different selector strategies in Test Flow

### Loop not grouping correctly
- Verify column names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check data is sorted by grouping columns
- Ensure loop start/end markers are properly matched

### Navigate URL not working
- Verify URLs in dataset are complete (include https://)
- Check for redirects that might interfere
- Add wait time after navigation if needed

## Support

For issues or questions, check:
1. Console logs (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Run.logs file for execution details
3. Test Flow mode for step validation

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions based on feedback:
- Conditional steps (if/then logic)
- Variable extraction and reuse
- Custom wait conditions
- Data transformations
- API integrations
